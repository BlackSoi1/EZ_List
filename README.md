# To-Do List 

## "EZ"
The to-do list application is named **EZ**. This application has following *features*: 
- Adding item to the list
- Cross items off
- Showing all  items
- Showing completed items
- Set priorities of items
- Remind user when items in the list approach the deadline
  
 This software is designed for anyone who wants to keep tracking their to-do list, managing 
 their work and reminding them not to miss the deadline. Since the second year in university,
 there are much more assignments and tests. I find it is difficult to remember all the deadlines
 in mind. I used fews to-do list applications before. However, in my opinion, these softwares are
 too "powerful". For example, some of them have a news section and some of them can edit the background
 picture of the list. I want to make a simple to-do list application that only do *"to-do list"* work.
 And this is the reason why I named it "EZ".
